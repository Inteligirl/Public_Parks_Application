# Public Parks Application Senior Capstone Project
Completed April 2020.

## Project Details
This project was assigned to myself and two other students. Together as a team we had to decide what to build an applicaiton for. The documents for the development of the applicaiton can be found [here](researchpapers/SeniorCapstoneProject). Working together my team took turns on various roles throughout the development phases of this project. The files in this folder contain the actual application code. It was decided to write this project in C# using Visual Studio. My major contribution to this code was the layout of the applicaiton, navigation frames and other small design items. The functionality and testing of this application along with it's database is the property of my teammates. 

## Thoughts and Problems
Some of the difficulty I experienced in this project was my lack of programming knowledge of C#. It had been almost 2 years since my last code development using that language. Thanks to Stack Overflow and some late nights reviewing old textbooks I was able to refresh my knowledge and complete my assigned portion of the project. The various documentatio need prior to begining code development of a project was all new to me. I have an understanding of Agile workflows but have never worked in a group with it. My partners were already employed in technology fields unlike myself. However, both of them were very helpful explaining different aspects of the project and how to collaborate.
